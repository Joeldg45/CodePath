Question 1:
You are facilitating a group of 5 students, and 1 student never participates. You ask after class how you can help. 
The student shares that they are very far behind, and don't know how to keep up because everyone talks so fast. 
How would you structure the next session to support this student?

To help address the student from feeling rushed and falling behind. I would provide additional support during office hours where they can feel comfortable to
ask questions without feeling rushed. I would also try to encouraging particiaption among the students where they can feel supported by classmates. I would also
provide the student learning material ahead of time, so they can read ahead and be prepared before the class begins. That way they will already be famaliar with
the material beforehand. Also reviewing the material the student may have missed during the session inside of office hours. 

Question 2:
You are facilitating a group of three students. Two of the students speak up for the majority of the time. 
They seem to enjoy engaging with one another, and with the group. One of the students comes to you after class one day, 
and shares that they want to participate more, but feel like when they try to do so, they get cut off or talked over. 
How would you support all of your students toward more equal participation in the next session?

To encourage equal participation among students in a way that is engaging and fun. I would have a talking pillow meaning that who ever has the pillow is the dedicated speaker 
and could also have a round robin approach where each person gets a turn to speak. I would also call on the quieter students to get their input to help balance 
the classroom dynamics.
